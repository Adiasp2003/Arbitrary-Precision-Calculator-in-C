# Arbitrary Precision Calculator (C)

This project implements an **Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC)** in C to perform arithmetic operations on numbers of any length, beyond the limits of built-in data types. The calculator represents large numbers using **linked lists**, enabling accurate computation for very large integers.

The project emphasizes **data structures, pointer manipulation, and algorithmic problem-solving**.

## 📌 Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of large integers
- Handles numbers with arbitrary number of digits
- Implements arithmetic logic using **linked list–based representation**
- Ensures correct handling of carry and borrow operations
- Modular and memory-efficient design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C  
- **Data Structures:** Linked Lists  
- **Core Concepts:** Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation  
- **Algorithms:** Digit-by-digit arithmetic

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input numbers are read as strings.
2. Each digit is stored as a node in a linked list.
3. Arithmetic operations are performed digit by digit:
   - Carry handling for addition and multiplication
   - Borrow handling for subtraction
4. The resulting linked list is traversed to display the final output.
