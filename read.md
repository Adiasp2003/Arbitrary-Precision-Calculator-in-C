An **arbitrary precision calculator** is a tool that can work with numbers of any size, even numbers much bigger than what normal data types like `int` or `long long` can store. It stores each digit separately and does the calculation step by step, just like how we do math on paper.

It is useful because normal numbers can overflow or lose accuracy. Arbitrary precision is needed in places like cryptography, scientific calculations, finance, big data, and anywhere large or very accurate numbers are required. It also helps learners understand how big number arithmetic works internally.
